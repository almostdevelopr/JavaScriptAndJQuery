    <h2>JS can change the style of an HTML element</h2>
    <p id="demo" style="display: none">
      JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept
      and design. JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an
      ECMA standard in 1997. ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard.
      ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
